v3.0: <br />
This version added the ability for the bot to skip new words. I built my versions of the bot using this code as a base. <br />

v3.5: <br />
This version made it so the bot defaulted to being on. It also added some QoL improvements with the buttons.  <br />

v4.0: <br />
This was the first version with the 90% correct system. A little bit clunky and in need of some fixes.  <br />

v4.01: <br />
This version shuffled around some button functions and improved the base 90% system. <br />

v4.02: <br />
This version added new console status updates to make the operation of the bot easier to understand. <br />

v4.1: <br />
This version added some random deviation to the answer accuracy. At the beginning of the session the bot picks a random percentage between 89% and 94% to target for question accuracy. The bot will get roughly the defined percentage of questions correct, adding some randomness to your session accuracy. Some console updates were also implemented. <br />
Note: Due to the limited amount of questions in a regular 15 min session, the actual accuracy can deviate from the target accuracy by a couple percentage points. <br />

v4.11: <br />
The bot will now rescan the page if it cannot find a question to answer quickly enough. This will prevent getting stuck on long loading screens. It will also print the time (in seconds) until the question is answered directly to the console. <br />

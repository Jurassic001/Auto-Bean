Ver 3.0: <br />
This version added the ability for the bot to skip new words. I built my versions of the bot using this code as a base. <br />

Ver 3.5: <br />
This version made it so the bot defaulted to being on. It also added some QoL improvements with the buttons.  <br />

Ver 4.0: <br />
This was the first version with the 90% correct system. A little bit clunky and in need of some fixes.  <br />

Ver 4.1: <br />
This version shuffled around some button functions and improved the base 90% system. <br />

Ver 4.2: <br />
This version added new console status updates to make the operation of the bot easier to understand. <br />
